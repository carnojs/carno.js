# Core Overview

The `@carno.js/core` package provides the fundamental building blocks of your application: the HTTP server, Dependency Injection container, and lifecycle management.

## The Carno Application

The `Carno` class is the entry point. It manages configuration, plugins, and the server lifecycle.

```ts
import { Carno } from '@carno.js/core';

const app = new Carno();
await app.listen(3000);
```

### Configuration

You can pass a configuration object to the constructor:

```ts
const app = new Carno({
  // Global middlewares
  globalMiddlewares: [],
  
  // Validation (Zod by default)
  validation: true, 
  
  // CORS Settings
  cors: { origins: '*' }
});
```

## Lifecycle & Controllers

Controllers in Carno.js are **Singletons by default**. They are instantiated once during application startup. This design choice enables aggressive optimizations, such as ahead-of-time (AOT) handler compilation and route flattening.

When a controller is instantiated, all its dependencies are resolved from the DI container.

### Lifecycle Hooks
Components can hook into the application lifecycle:
- `@OnApplicationInit()`: Called after the DI container is fully built.
- `@OnApplicationBoot()`: Called when the server starts listening (port binding).
- `@OnApplicationShutdown()`: Called on graceful shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT).

## Plugins & Modules

Carno.js allows you to split your application into independent modules (plugins). Each plugin is a `Carno` instance that can have its own controllers, services, and middlewares.

### Encapsulation Rules

- **Controllers**: Controllers defined in a plugin are automatically registered with the main application's router. **Their routes are publicly accessible.** You do not need to export controllers.
- **Services**: Are **private** by default. To share a service with another module (e.g. valid for injection in the root app or other plugins), you must strictly add it to the `exports` array.
- **Middlewares**: Global middlewares defined in a plugin are merged into the main pipeline.

```ts
// auth.module.ts
export const AuthModule = new Carno({
  exports: [AuthService] // AuthService can now be injected elsewhere
});
AuthModule.services([AuthService, PrivateStrategy]); // PrivateStrategy is internal
AuthModule.controllers([AuthController]);
```

```ts
// index.ts
import { Carno } from '@carno.js/core';
import { AuthModule } from './auth.module';

const app = new Carno();
app.use(AuthModule); // Imports routes and exported services
```
